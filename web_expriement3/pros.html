        <p>
            At the beginning ,I get very confused on the componens,the gpt4 helps me a lot.<br>
     I thought 'student' in the 'components' is a template id ,so I thought here should not be student but <br>
     student-template,but now I know it is the register name, which you can name it as you like.<br>
    <br>
        My question:<br>
        Here the code just define a 'student' that doesn't appear it in the front it ,what does it mean?<br>
        components: {<br>
        student: studentComponent//register a <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
        Its answer:<br>
    In the Vue.js code you provided, the components property inside the Vue app is used to register a component locally to that Vue instance.<br>
     Here's a breakdown of how this works:<br>
    
    You've created a template with the ID student-template. <br>
    This template will be used as the layout for the student component.<br>
    You then define a component object named studentComponent:<br>
    javascript<br>
    (1)<br>
    var studentComponent = {<br>
        template: "#student-template",<br>
        props: ['name', 'studentid']<br>
    }<br>
    
    This component uses the #student-template for its layout and has two props: name and studentid.<br>
    
    Within the main Vue app instance, you're registering this component with the name student:<br>
    (2)<br>
    javascript<br>
    components: {<br>
        student: studentComponent<br>
    }<br>
    This means that within the Vue instance's template (the part inside <div id="app">...</div>),<br>
     you can now use <student> as a tag to insert an instance of the studentComponent into the DOM.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <template id="student-template">
        <div>
            <p>Name: {{ name }}</p>
            <p>Student ID: {{ studentid }}</p>
        </div>
    </template>
    <script>
        var studentComponent = {
            template: "#student-template",
            props: ['name', 'studentid']//get the data from parent component.
        }

        const app = Vue.createApp({
            data() {
                return {
                    students: [
                        {name: "邹嘉豪", sid: '202112900329'},
                        {name: "小民", sid: '231203203203'}
                    ]
                }
            },
            components: {
                student: studentComponent//register a component
            }
        })

        app.mount("#app");//mount the div 
    </script>
