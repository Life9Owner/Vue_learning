<!-- /* At the beginning ,I get very confused on the componens,the gpt4 helps me a lot.*/ -->
<!-- 
    My question:
    Here the code just define a 'student' that doesn't appear it in the front it ,what does it mean?
    components: {
    student: studentComponent//register a component
} -->
    <!-- Its answer:
In the Vue.js code you provided, the components property inside the Vue app is used to register a component locally to that Vue instance.
 Here's a breakdown of how this works:

You've created a template with the ID student-template. 
This template will be used as the layout for the student component.
You then define a component object named studentComponent:
javascript
(1)
var studentComponent = {
    template: "#student-template",
    props: ['name', 'studentid']
}

This component uses the #student-template for its layout and has two props: name and studentid.

Within the main Vue app instance, you're registering this component with the name student:
(2)
javascript
components: {
    student: studentComponent
}
This means that within the Vue instance's template (the part inside <div id="app">...</div>),
 you can now use <student> as a tag to insert an instance of the studentComponent into the DOM. -->
